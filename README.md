# Travelling-website


# Description
Developed a web platform to help visitors make their travel plans, using NodsJS and MongoDB mainly. Enabling users to search and discover various destinations and add them to their want-to-go list. Vistor can navigate through a collection of sites such as Paris, Rome, Santorini and more, or use the search feature to find his preferred destination.

##  Tools And Technologies

We used the following technologies:
- **Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **Express.js** is a web application framework for Node.js, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **Ejs** is a templating engine for Node.js.
- **MongoDB** is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- **Git** a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
